# Predicting Solar Power Output Using Linear Regression

## Description

This project uses linear regression to predict solar power output based on weather data. The model takes features such as temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance to forecast power generation. It can be useful for optimizing solar power usage and energy grid management.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dependencies

* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
* numpy: For numerical computations
* seaborn: For data visualization
* matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
* scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks, including linear regression

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the script to train the model and make predictions

## Code Structure

* `dataset`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing
* `main`: Trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates the results 

## Future Improvements

* Collect more data to improve the model's accuracy
* Experiment with different machine learning algorithms
* Deploy the model in a production-ready environment
