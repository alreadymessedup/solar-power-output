# Predicting Solar Power Output Using Linear Regression

## Description

This project uses linear regression to predict solar power output based on weather data. The model takes features such as temperature, humidity, and solar irradiance to forecast power generation. It can be useful for optimizing solar power usage and energy grid management.

## Installation

```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn
